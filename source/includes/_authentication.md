## Authentication

Diffbot uses API tokens to grant access to the API. You can register for a Diffbot API key [here](https://www.diffbot.com/plans/trial).



Diffbot expects for the API token to be included in all API requests to the server as a query parameter like so:

`?token=mrrobotico`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>mrrobotico</code> with your personal API token.
